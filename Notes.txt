And the result is, from the most recent last game within this time limit,

a) did they win?
b) did both/them/opponent/neither lose their queen?

And display a picture to show this.

And then after this I would put a pin in this task.



TODO - en passant

TODO - fix type resolution
TODO - fix bug with input sizing for Days option

Goals for today -

design flip-side of card for game result

for each piece (Pawn / Rook / Knight / Bishop / Queen) and player (black / white), display

a) difference between gained / lost with correct format (green or red or black relative to opponent)
b) highlight easily which colour the player was.

Grid-like structure -

					white			black
Queen
Rook
Knight
Bishop
Pawn
