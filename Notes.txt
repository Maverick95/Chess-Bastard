I would investigate the query for current games.
I'd like to know whether somebody played a time game within a recent limit.
And then display -

a) bullet if playing bullet,
b) blitz if playing blitz,
c) ...,
d) o/w last login

https://api.chess.com/pub/player/nickemmerson/games/2022/03

And the result is, from the most recent last game within this time limit,

a) did they win?
b) did both/them/opponent/neither lose their queen?

And display a picture to show this.

And then after this I would put a pin in this task.

did each player lose their queen???

{
  white : { lostQueen: boolean }
  black : { lostQueen: boolean }
}

keep track of where each player's queen is

white starts with queen on d1, black on d8

ALSO

need to keep track of promotions to queen

need to track where ALL of the queens are

summarise with -

queens initial - 1
queens gained -
queens lost -

{
  white: { queen: { initial, gained, lost } }
}

Pseudo-code :

begin with

{
	white: { queen: { initial: 1, gained: 0, lost: 0, positions: [ 'd1' ] } }
	black: { queen: { initial: 1, gained: 0, lost: 0, position: [ 'd8' ] } }
}

For each move (using white WLOG)

a) if castling, ignore
b) space being moved to, does black have queen there?
	if so, remove queen, add to lost count
c) piece being moved, is this a queen? if so, update the relevant position
( this may be tricky to identify 
d) if not, is it a pawn being promoted to a queen? if so, update the queen count,
add in new queen position

Summarize what you want to happen :
a) 2nd side to cards that contain more specific details of recent game.
b) Accessible when user has recent game.
c) When this happens, you can click the card to make the flip happen.
d) When you switch to the other side, queries stop updating, until you flip back.

How to make this happen?

State level variables on ChessPlayerComponent to indicate the side.
Set up component to render other blank side if state changes.

How to simulate a card flip?

Need to split into 2 very different card components.

These 2 card components are ALWAYS rendered.

What are the different ways of making this happen?

For now, try a horizontal flip.

WLOG

Active card			top = 0, left = 0, width = 100%, height = 100%,	transition-props = left and width, transition-delay = 50% of time
Inactive card		top = 0, left = 50%, width = 0%, height = 100%,	transition-props = left and width, transition-delay = 0% of time
