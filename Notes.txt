I would investigate the query for current games.
I'd like to know whether somebody played a time game within a recent limit.
And then display -

a) bullet if playing bullet,
b) blitz if playing blitz,
c) ...,
d) o/w last login

And the result is, from the most recent last game within this time limit,

a) did they win?
b) did both/them/opponent/neither lose their queen?

And display a picture to show this.

And then after this I would put a pin in this task.

Flashing images will show recent game type along with win/loss.

a) Better images
b) Flashing animation
