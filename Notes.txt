So, what first then?

I guess at first I would like to see what API calls I can make.

The initial aim is to see whether I can detect, "is player currently playing?"

Also maybe fetch certain details?

Lets see the API calls?

Images are 200 x 200 pixels, this should be standard.

So what I would like to do, as a first exercise, is to see whether you can keep a list of
players' names in a JSON file somewhere, parse this, and for each user, create a separate
grid-tab showing key details for the user.

The last login time is not shown in time but in a useful format,
either
X minutes ago Green
X hours ago Orange / yellow
X days ago Grey
whichever is the minimum that fits

So best get started with the JSON? Or with the links?

I would say the links.

So begin with just a simple component, username prop

Initially component will just have a set state of Loading.

Yeah I remember this they use a reducer with a state of LOADING.

Since these are 200 x 200, draw up a default img to use.

I'd like to design a simple loading component.

What is the next step here?

I would say, designing the simple card structure to show the player.

How about ripping off say a common playing card design?

Done, next!
